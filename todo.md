## Current Step
**Status**: Completed Step 3.3
**Next**: Step 3.2 - Text file reader (or move to Step 4.1)

## Test Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 90%+
- Integration Tests: 80%+
- E2E Tests: Key workflows

## Notes
- Each step must have tests written first (TDD)
- No step should be larger than 2-3 hours of work
- Integration happens continuously, not at the end
- All code must be working and integrated at each step

## Dependencies Installed
- [x] click
- [x] pydantic
- [x] pydantic-settings
- [x] claude-code-sdk
- [x] pytest
- [x] pytest-asyncio
- [x] pytest-cov
- [x] chardet
- [x] pyyaml

## Environment Setup
- [x] .env.example file created
- [ ] .env file created (user needs to copy and add API key)
- [ ] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configured
